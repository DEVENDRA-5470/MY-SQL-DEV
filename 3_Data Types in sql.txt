Certainly! Here's the revised explanation including the DECIMAL data type with syntaxes:

1. **VARCHAR**:
   - Stands for "Variable Character."
   - Stores variable-length character strings.
   - Requires storage space equal to the actual length of the data plus two bytes.
   - Suitable for storing strings where the length may vary, such as names, addresses, or descriptions.
   - **Storage Size:** 0 to 255 bytes + actual length
   - **Syntax:** VARCHAR(size)

2. **CHAR**:
   - Stands for "Character."
   - Stores fixed-length character strings.
   - Padding with spaces to the specified length if the actual string is shorter.
   - Suitable for storing fixed-length data like codes or identifiers.
   - **Storage Size:** Specified length in bytes
   - **Syntax:** CHAR(size)

3. **TEXT**:
   - Stores large amounts of text data.
   - Maximum size varies depending on the database engine but can typically store up to 65,535 characters.
   - Suitable for storing large blocks of text like articles, comments, or notes.
   - **Storage Size:** Up to 65,535 bytes
   - **Syntax:** TEXT

4. **INT**:
   - Stands for "Integer."
   - Stores whole numbers within a range defined by the size of the integer type.
   - Suitable for storing numerical data like counts, quantities, or IDs.
   - **Storage Size:** 4 bytes
   - **Syntax:** INT

5. **BIGINT**:
   - Stores larger whole numbers than INT.
   - Allows for a wider range of values compared to INT.
   - Suitable for storing very large numerical data like IDs or counts when the INT range is insufficient.
   - **Storage Size:** 8 bytes
   - **Syntax:** BIGINT

6. **DATE**:
   - Stores date values in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
   - Suitable for storing date information like birthdates, event dates, or deadlines.
   - **Storage Size:** 3 bytes
   - **Syntax:** DATE

7. **DATETIME**:
   - Stores date and time values in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.
   - Suitable for storing timestamps with both date and time components, like when a record was created or updated.
   - **Storage Size:** 8 bytes
   - **Syntax:** DATETIME

8. **TIMESTAMP**:
   - Stores a timestamp representing a specific moment in time.
   - Often used for recording the creation or last modification time of a record.
   - Typically represented internally as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).
   - Automatically updated by the database when the row is created or modified.
   - **Storage Size:** 4 bytes
   - **Syntax:** TIMESTAMP

9. **DECIMAL**:
   - Represents fixed-point numbers with a user-specified precision and scale.
   - Suitable for storing exact numeric data like monetary amounts.
   - **Storage Size:** Variable, depends on the specified precision and scale.
   - **Syntax:** DECIMAL(precision, scale)
