Database operators are symbols or keywords used in SQL queries to perform operations such as comparison, arithmetic, logical, and string manipulation. Here are some common types of operators in SQL:

1. **Comparison Operators**:
   - Used to compare values in the WHERE clause of a query.
   - Examples: = (equal to), <> or != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to)

2. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - Used to perform mathematical calculations on numeric values.
   - Examples: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus)

3. **Logical Operators**:
   - Used to combine conditions in the WHERE clause.
   - Examples: AND (logical AND), OR (logical OR), NOT (logical NOT)

4. **String Concatenation Operator**:
   - Used to concatenate strings together.
   - Example: || (double pipes)

5. **Wildcard Operators**:
   - Used in conjunction with LIKE or NOT LIKE to match patterns in string values.
   - Examples: % (matches any sequence of characters), _ (matches any single character)

6. **IN Operator**:
   - Used to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
   - Example: IN (value1, value2, ...)

7. **BETWEEN Operator**:
   - Used to specify a range of values in a WHERE clause.
   - Example: BETWEEN value1 AND value2

8. **IS NULL Operator**:
   - Used to check if a value is NULL.
   - Example: IS NULL

9. **IS NOT NULL Operator**:
   - Used to check if a value is not NULL.
   - Example: IS NOT NULL

These operators are fundamental in constructing SQL queries to retrieve, manipulate, and filter data stored in a database. Understanding how to use them effectively is crucial for working with databases efficiently.
