A "clause" refers to a distinct part of a SQL statement that serves a specific purpose. There are several clauses used in SQL queries to perform special operations.

1. **SELECT Clause**:
   - Used to specify the columns to be retrieved from a table.
   - Syntax: `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name`

2. **FROM Clause**:
   - Specifies the table or tables from which to retrieve the data.
   - Syntax: `SELECT column1 FROM table_name`

3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Used to filter rows based on a specified condition.
   - Syntax: `SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition`

4. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
   - Syntax: `SELECT column1, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1`

5. **HAVING Clause**:
   - Used in combination with the GROUP BY clause to specify a condition for grouping rows.
   - Syntax: `SELECT column1, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 HAVING condition`

6. **ORDER BY Clause**:
   - Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.
   - Syntax: `SELECT column1 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC/DESC`

7. **LIMIT Clause**:
   - Limits the number of rows returned by a query.
   - Syntax: `SELECT column1 FROM table_name LIMIT n`

8. **OFFSET Clause**:
   - Specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows.
   - Syntax: `SELECT column1 FROM table_name OFFSET n`

9. **JOIN Clause**:
   - Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
   - Syntax: `SELECT column1 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column`

10. **UNION Clause**:
    - Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.
    - Syntax: `SELECT column1 FROM table1 UNION SELECT column1 FROM table2`

These clauses are essential components of SQL queries and are used to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data stored in a database. Understanding how to use them effectively is crucial for writing efficient and powerful SQL queries.
